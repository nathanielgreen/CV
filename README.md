# Skills

## Web Development

- [Ushare](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/Ushare), my final project at
  Makers Academy built over the course of 2 weeks in a team of 4. An Uber Cab
  sharing app built using Meteor, Leaflet.js, with a Rails back end, hooking
  into the Uber API.
- [Ravebot](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/ravebot), a social playlist curation
  app built for iOS and Android using the Ionic Framework and Rails for the
  back end.
- [Show Star Website](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/showstar), A website
  built for the company ShowStar Entertainments, made to showcase various clubs
  and events owned by the company. It was built in close contact with the client
  with very specific design requests.
- [RemoteMe](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/remoteme), a web app that allows
  users to find, list, and rate areas in their city that are laptop-work
  friendly.

## Fast and Passionate Learner

- Grasped a good understanding of multiple languages and different technologies in a short space of time
  through self-taught learning and using online resources, as well as Makers
  Academy resources.
- Having a strong interest in current mobile technology influenced my decision
  to learn [Meteor](http://meteor.com/), a powerful Javascript framework that
  can create phone apps quickly and easily and has been the basis for multiple
  personal projects of mine.
