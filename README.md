# Skills

## Web Development

- [UNDRGRND](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/UNDRGRND): an ongoing personal
  project of mine; UNDRGRND is social network for the underground music scene.
  Built to enable me to practice some of my favourite tech, such as Nuxt.js, Vue.js,
  and GraphQL.
- [Bullet Journal](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/bulletjournal): the analog 
  organization system [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) in
  the form of a PWA. Built using Nuxt.js + Vue.js.
- [Ushare](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/Ushare): my final project at
  Makers Academy built over the course of 2 weeks in a team of 4. An Uber Cab
  sharing app built using Meteor, Leaflet.js, with a Rails back end, hooking
  into the Uber API.
- [Ravebot](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/ravebot): a social playlist curation
  app built for iOS and Android using the Ionic Framework and Rails for the
  back end.

## Fast and Passionate Learner

- Whilst attending Makers Academy web development bootcamp, I grasped a good 
  understanding of multiple languages and different technologies 
  in a short space of time through self-taught learning and using online resources, 
  as well as the bootcamps resources.
- Having a strong interest in SPAs and optimization influenced my decision
  to learn [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a powerful Vue.js framework that
  allows you to develop Server Side Rendered Vue.js web and progressive web
  applications..

## Technologies and Languages

Some of my favourite tech at the moment:
`Nuxt.js` `Vue.js` `Vuex` `SASS` `CSS Grid` `Firebase` `GraphQL` `Apollo`
