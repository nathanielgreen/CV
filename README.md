available for full-time employment as a Full-stack Developer, in London
UK.
Previously employed as a Software Engineer at [Veratrak](https://veratrak.com/),

# Skills

## Web Development

- [Bullet Buddy](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/bulletbuddy): A PWA
  (Progressive Web App) built with Vue.js+Vuex and PouchDB. The app presents the
  analog organization system [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) in
  the digital form of a PWA.

  Built to enable me to practice some of my favourite tech, such as Nuxt.js, Vue.js,
  and GraphQL.

  Makers Academy built over the course of 2 weeks in a team of 4. An Uber Cab
  sharing app built using Meteor, Leaflet.js, with a Rails back end, hooking

## Fast and Passionate Learner

- Having a strong interest in SPAs and optimization influenced my decision
  to learn [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a powerful Vue.js framework that
  allows you to develop Server Side Rendered Vue.js web and progressive web
  applications.
- Whilst attending Makers Academy web development bootcamp, I grasped a good 
  understanding of multiple languages and different technologies 
  in a short space of time through self-taught learning and using online resources, 
  as well as the bootcamps resources.

## Technologies and Languages

Some of my favourite tech at the moment:
`Nuxt.js` `Vue.js` `CSS Grid` `PWA` `Elixir` `Rust` `Web Assembly`
