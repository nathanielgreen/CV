A technology enthusiast with a passion for creating new things. Recently finished the Makers Academy coding course and currently looking for full-time employment as a junior web developer in London.

## Skills

#### Web Development

- [Ushare](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/Ushare), my final project at
  Makers Academy built over the course of 2 weeks in a team of 4. An Uber Cab
  sharing app built using Meteor, Leaflet.js, with a Rails back end, hooking
  into the Uber API.
- [Ravebot](https://github.com/nathanielgreen/ravebot), a social playlist curation
  app built for iOS and Android using the Ionic Framework and Rails for the
  back end.

#### Fast and Passionate Learner

- Grasped a good understanding of multiple languages and different technologies in a short space of time
  through self-taught learning and using online resources, as well as Makers
  Academy resources.
- Having a strong interest in current mobile technology influenced my decision
  to learn [Meteor](http://meteor.com/), a powerful Javascript framework that
  can create phone apps quickly and easily and has been the basis for multiple
  personal projects of mine.
